## Produce 101 Data Analysis

- This is a website about the korean show [Produce
    101](https://www.google.com/search?q=Produce+101&oq=Produce+101&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i65l2j69i61j69i59.354j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
-   The main goal of my project is to explore which kind of trainees in
    the show are more likely to debut.
