You can use book, google for examples, etc. Please use dplyr and ggplot as appropriate to explore, obtain results, and present findings.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
df <- flights
```
```{r}
flights
```


## Task 1
Imagine you are choosing a ticket to fly _from_ JFK. You want to know which day of the week (Mon, Tue, ...) has lowest delays, and which one largest. How big is the difference? Is it big enough to make you choose one day vs another? 

__Hint__
use lubridate package. Google "lubridate vignette". Many packages in R have these "vignettes" showing examples and explaining how to use a package. You will have to combine columns. There is a function which will provide you with the weekday number, given the columns with date. Be careful in interpreting a returned result.

```{r}
flights_delay_by_day <- group_by(flights, wday(time_hour, label = TRUE))
summarise(flights_delay_by_day, 
          dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
          arr_delay_mean = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
arrange(dep_delay_mean)
```
By calculating the departure and arrival delays, we can see that on average, Saturdays have lowest delays and Thursdays have highest delays.

### Comment
* Good
* (-1) You did include flights originated from other airports as well
* graph could help. Point, or boxplot, or both.
* how big is standart deviation and standart error for that matter for these means?
* how big is the difference in mean delays between delays?
* may be median is a better way (comparing ot mean) to describe this?
* the units of delay are not clear. Mention them when you interpret the results
* next you could do parametric or non-parametric ANOVA, if you know it
* Please, use notebook instead of Rmd files

## Taks 2
Now choose a particular destination, what can you say now?
```{r}
(flights_delay_by_day_IAH <- filter(flights, dest == "IAH") %>%
  group_by(wday(time_hour, label = TRUE))%>%
  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
          arr_delay_mean = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
   arrange(dep_delay_mean)
   )

flights_delay_IAH <- filter(flights, dest == "IAH") %>%
    mutate(wkday = wday(time_hour, label = TRUE))

flights_delay_IAH_ <- filter(flights, dest == "IAH") %>%
    mutate(wkday = wday(time_hour, label = TRUE))%>%
    filter(dep_delay<300)

  ggplot(data = flights_delay_IAH_) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = wkday,y = dep_delay))
  
  ggplot(data = flights_delay_IAH) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = arr_delay,y = dep_delay,color = wkday))
```
This is for the destination IAH (George Bush Intercontinental Airport). The table shows that the delay situation is similar to the general data. The delays are lowest on Tuesdays and Saturdays, highest on Mondays and Thursdays. In general, the average delay is little lower than average for all airports.
The boxplot and dotplot shows that there's no significant difference between the days.The medians are similar. 

### Comment

* good
* after you did graph, analyze it. For example 
    * on the last plot (which you do not discuss at all) there are some dots, where dep_delay is 0, but arrival delay ~100. What does it represent?
    * what this last plot shows you? correlation between dep_delay and arr_delay? What do you see? May be smooth line would help here?
    * acctually, very itneresting plot by itself...

## Taks 3
Now for a chosen destination, choose a best carrier-weekday combination. Compare it to the worst one.
```{r}
flights_delay_IAH

ggplot(data = flights_delay_IAH) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = arr_delay,y = dep_delay),alpha = 1/10) +
  facet_grid(carrier~wkday)
```

The graph shows the delay time vesues arrival time. An ideal flight would be positioned at the bottom left. The 14 grids are for different combinations of weekdays and carriers. It seemss that the best choice would be AA(American Airways) on Saturdays. The delays are minimum and there's few outliers. The UA(United Airlines) delays are significantly higher than the AA carrier, and Thursdays seems to be the worst with higher outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights_delay_IAH_) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=wkday, y = dep_delay)) +
  facet_wrap(~carrier)
```
(to see a clearer trend, data with )
This boxplot also compares the two companies and weekdays. It shows that AA have less outliers and lower median.

### Comment

* Very good

## Task 4
For the chosen best carrier-destination combination compare delays at a regular day vs one of the national holidays.
```{r}
(flights_delay_by_day_IAH_AA <- 
   filter(flights_delay_IAH,wkday == "Sat") %>%
    mutate(d_d = lubridate::date(time_hour)))

(flights_delay_by_day_IAH_AA_date <- 
  filter(flights_delay_by_day_IAH_AA, d_d == "2014-12-25"))
```
Haven't find a holiday with flights yet...

### Comment

* Please use select to keep only those columns you need. This way when you print df you would see the structure of columns. 
* look at range(flights_delay_by_day_IAH_AA$d_d) - there is no "2014-12-25" for this one. 
* (-1) flights_delay_by_day_IAH_AA contains only Saturdays. Are you sure 2014-12-25 is Saturday? The following code would find some flights in range for you    
      flights_delay_IAH %>%
          mutate(d_d = lubridate::date(time_hour)) %>%
          filter(d_d == "2013-07-04")
