## Chicago taxi data
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew/data 

### Data description: This is data from taxi trips reported to the city of Chicago. There are total 112860054 rows and 23 variables including information about the taxi, time, location and expenses.

Please distinct between header and normal text - ttry pressign Previw and see how it looks in html 



### Time estimation: download for 100 seconds, 57.1MB, 194455 rows. So the time takes to download whole dataset should be about 16 hours. Size of whole data set should be about 33GB.

## Analysis
### 6. After you have data, Make table with day of the week in the column name, Length of a trip in vertical (you will have to cut it, to let say 5 intervals), and average tip in cells 

###6a. Be carefull - if you apply cut blindly, using intervals, outliers (if present) can make this cutting useless. You need to see how many records there are in every group.

- Clean variable "Tips"
```{r}
df$Tips <- str_replace_all(df$Tips, "\\$", "") %>%
  as.numeric()
```

- Get three variables
```{r}
table_tips <- df %>% 
  select(Trip.Start.Timestamp, Trip.End.Timestamp, Tips) %>%
  mutate(Start_date = mdy_hms(Trip.Start.Timestamp))  %>%
  mutate(wkday = wday(Start_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  separate(Start_date, c("st_date","st_time"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate(st_time, c("st_hr","st_min","st_sc"), sep = ":") %>%
  mutate(End_date = mdy_hms(Trip.End.Timestamp))  %>%
  separate(End_date, c("ed_date","ed_time"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate(ed_time, c("ed_hr","ed_min","ed_sc"), sep = ":") %>%
  mutate(hr = as.numeric(ed_hr) - as.numeric(st_hr)) %>%
  mutate(min = as.numeric(ed_min) - as.numeric(st_min)) %>%
  filter(hr>0) %>%
  mutate(Duration = hr*60 + min) %>%
  select(wkday,Duration,Tips) 
  table_tips 
```

- Select intervals so that there's enough data in each cell.
```{r}
table_tips_n_ob <- table_tips %>%
  group_by(wkday, Duration_interval = cut(Duration,breaks = c(0,15,30,45,60,1500)))%>%
  summarise(ob = n()) %>%
  spread(wkday,ob)
table_tips_n_ob

table_tips_n_ob_group <- table_tips %>%
  group_by(Duration_interval = cut(Duration,breaks = c(0,15,30,45,60,1500)))%>%
  summarise(ob = n())
table_tips_n_ob_group
```

- Average tip for each day and duration of trip
```{r}
table_tips_wkday <- table_tips %>%
  group_by(wkday, Duration_interval = cut(Duration, breaks = c(0,15,30,45,60,1500))) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = mean(Tips, na.rm = T)) %>%
  spread(wkday,avg_tip)%>%
mutate(Duration_interval = fct_recode(Duration_interval, `15 min` = "(0,15]", 
                                  `30 min` = "(15,30]",
                                  `45 min` = "(30,45]",
                                  `60 min` = "(45,60]",
                                  `Over an hour` = "(60,1.5e+03]"
))
table_tips_wkday
```

+(data preparation), +(table), +(cut)

###6b. Combine length of trip with number of recods in parentecies - to use as first column 

```{r}
table_tips_n_ob_group$ob<- paste0("(",format(table_tips_n_ob_group$ob),")")
table_tips_wkday %>%
  mutate(n_obsevations = table_tips_n_ob_group$ob) %>%
  unite(`Duration(n of observations)`, Duration_interval, n_obsevations, sep = " ")
```

###Plot this data. Make plot with separation by morning-day-evening-night. Best to drive 

- Get time of week, time of day and corresponding tips.
```{r}
table_time <- df %>% 
  select(Trip.Start.Timestamp, Tips) %>%
  mutate(Start_date = mdy_hms(Trip.Start.Timestamp))  %>%
  mutate(wkday = wday(Start_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  separate(Start_date, c("st_date","st_time"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate(st_time, c("st_hr","st_min","st_sc"), sep = ":") %>%
  mutate(start_hr = as.numeric(st_hr)) %>%
  select(Tips, start_hr, wkday) %>%
  group_by(wkday, time_of_day = cut(start_hr, breaks = c(0,6,9,16,20,24))) %>%
  filter(is.na(time_of_day) == F) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = mean(Tips, na.rm = T)) 
table_time
```
```{r}
table_time_of_day <- table_time %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = fct_recode(time_of_day, Before_dawn = "(0,6]", 
                                  Morning = "(6,9]",
                                  Day = "(9,16]",
                                  Evening = "(16,20]",
                                  Night = "(20,24]"
))

ggplot(table_time_of_day, aes(x = time_of_day, y = wkday)) +
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = avg_tip))
```
According to the graph, the tips are generally higher during Saturday or during the morning.
